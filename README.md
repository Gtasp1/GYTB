# GYTB
Super simple custom badge homebrew for the 3DS. Just add the badges you want as 64x64 PNGs in the badges folder, and run the homebrew to transfer them to your home menu.

Note that GYTB does *not* work in tandem with Nintendo's Badge Arcade: each will overwrite the badges of the other.

Running Badge Arcade to set up the extdata is also not required, so players stuck without eShop access should still be able to use this normally. However, a firmware of 9.5 or above is still necessary.
